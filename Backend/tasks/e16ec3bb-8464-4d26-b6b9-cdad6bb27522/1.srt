00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,925
Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily deploy applications inside containers

2
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:08,175
Containers are lightweight

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,162
standalone

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:13,550
executable packages that contain all the required components such as code

5
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:14,425
runtime

6
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:15,762
system tools

7
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:16,525
libraries

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,512
and settings for an application to run consistently across different computing environments

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:31,812
This consistency makes Docker highly valuable in mitigating the classic issue of software working on one system but not another due to environmental differences
