Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. It provides lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient modules that developers can use as building blocks. By using Docker, teams can streamline their development processes and scale applications quickly and efficiently.",
