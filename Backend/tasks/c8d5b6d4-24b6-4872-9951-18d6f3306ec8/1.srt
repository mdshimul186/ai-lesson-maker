1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,888
Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight

2
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:07,188
portable containers

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,475
These containers can run virtually anywhere

4
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:12,637
whether on a developer's local machine

5
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:13,800
a data center

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:14,963
or in the cloud

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,525
Docker containers package an application with all its dependencies

8
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:22,837
ensuring consistency across various environments

9
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:29,400
This encapsulation simplifies software delivery by isolating applications from infrastructure

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,850
which addresses the common issue of 'works on my machine'

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,087
Docker's architecture includes a daemon that manages containers

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:37,750
images

13
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:38,737
and networks

14
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:42,100
alongside a client utility to issue commands
