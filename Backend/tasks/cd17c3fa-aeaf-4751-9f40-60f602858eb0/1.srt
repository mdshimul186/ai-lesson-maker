00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,875
Docker is a platform designed to make it easier for developers to create

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:04,650
deploy

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:07,513
and run applications by using containers

4
00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:13,012
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs

5
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,675
such as libraries and other dependencies

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,188
and ship it all out as one package

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,075
By doing so

8
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:31,387
the developer can be assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code

9
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:32,913
With Docker

10
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:36,962
engineers can easily manage those tasks with fewer interruptions

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,900
ensuring their applications perform consistently
