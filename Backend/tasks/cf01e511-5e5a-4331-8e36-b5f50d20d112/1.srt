1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,025
Docker is a platform for developing

2
00:00:02,237 --> 00:00:02,812
shipping

3
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:05,562
and running applications inside containers

4
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:07,787
Containers are lightweight

5
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:08,963
executable

6
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:13,037
isolated environments that include everything needed to run an application

7
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:14,225
such as code

8
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:15,075
runtime

9
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,900
libraries

10
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:17,113
and system tools

11
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,375
This approach ensures consistency across different environments

12
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:23,300
from development to production

13
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:29,188
and helps to streamline the software development lifecycle by minimizing 'works on my machine' issues

14
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:33,650
Docker containers can be created and managed using the Docker Engine

15
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:35,350
which is available for Linux

16
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:36,150
Windows

17
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,150
and MacOS

18
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,663
Key features of Docker include image versioning

19
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,462
automated build processes

20
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,587
and the ability to share containerized applications through Docker Hub

21
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:48,725
a cloud-based registry service
