      "text": "Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, executable, isolated environments that include everything needed to run an application, such as code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. This approach ensures consistency across different environments, from development to production, and helps to streamline the software development lifecycle by minimizing 'works on my machine' issues. Docker containers can be created and managed using the Docker Engine, which is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. Key features of Docker include image versioning, automated build processes, and the ability to share containerized applications through Docker Hub, a cloud-based registry service.",

      "text": "Understanding how Docker containers work helps in optimizing deployment strategies and ensuring efficient resource management. A Docker container is essentially a runtime instance of a Docker image. The image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything essential to run a particular software, on any system. When a container runs, it utilizes an isolated filesystem based on the Docker image. Running processes inside the container cannot influence or access the host system, nor other containers, unless explicitly configured to do so. By employing Docker Compose, developers can define and manage multi-container applications, streamlining the testing and deployment process significantly.",
