1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,225
Docker is a platform used for developing

2
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:03,013
shipping

3
00:00:03,312 --> 00:00:05,463
and running applications in containers

4
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:10,775
Containers allow a developer to package an application with all parts it needs

5
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:13,425
such as libraries and other dependencies

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,938
and ship it all out as one package

7
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:22,200
Docker ensures that applications can be shipped and executed in any environment consistently

8
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:26,700
This portability is achieved through containerization technology

9
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:29,988
which provides a lightweight virtualized environment

10
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:34,525
Docker also integrates with popular CI/CD tools

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,163
allowing seamless and automated deployment processes
