Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,125
Containers are isolated from one another and come bundled with all their dependencies

3
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:16,275
allowing them to run on any machine that includes the Docker engine

4
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:19,387
regardless of the underlying operating environment

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,663
This simplifies the deployment of applications across various infrastructures by ensuring that code remains consistent from development through production
