and running applications

4
00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:09,100
enabling developers to separate their applications from their infrastructure

5
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:13,787
This separation allows for faster software delivery and deployment

6
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:21,712
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container

7
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:26,650
Containers have become the standard way to build and deploy modern applications

8
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:33,487
allowing dev teams to work in distributed modes and ensuring that applications run consistently on any device

9
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,450
on-premises

10
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:35,913
